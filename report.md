## Abstract

Cavity resonators, known for their ability to confine electromagnetic waves, have transitioned from classical microwave applications to a revolutionary role in quantum computing. Superconducting cavity resonators are now the backbone of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, enabling storage, manipulation, and readout of quantum information. This report delves into their theoretical background, mathematical equations, real-world applications, current research, and future evolution—highlighting their role in shaping next-gen technologies.

## 1. Introduction
Cavity resonators are metallic enclosures that support and confine electromagnetic fields. Initially used in applications like radar and microwave communications, they now play a critical role in quantum computing, especially in superconducting qubit architectures.

In such systems, superconducting cavity resonators act as quantum memory, logic gates, and communication buses. Their high-quality factor (Q), minimal energy loss, and strong coupling with superconducting qubits make them ideal for building scalable quantum processors.

## 2. Theory of Cavity Resonators
### 2.1 Electromagnetic Standing Waves

Cavity resonators confine EM waves and create standing wave patterns inside a closed volume. The resonant frequency depends on the physical dimensions and mode type (TE, TM, TEM).

# 3. Role in Quantum Computing
## 3.1 Superconducting Qubits & cQED
In circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), qubits (like transmons) are coupled to superconducting microwave cavities. The interaction allows precise quantum state control and readout.

### 3.2 Quantum Memory
The cavity can store quantum states longer than the qubit due to its higher Q factor.

### 3.3 Qubit Readout
Readout is achieved by measuring the resonance shift in the cavity frequency caused by the qubit's state.
